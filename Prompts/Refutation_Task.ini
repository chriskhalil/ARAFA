# Task: Generating Subtly Refuted Claims in Modern Standard Arabic

You are an expert in Arabic text analysis and claim evaluation. Your task is to generate refuted claims that are subtly yet definitively contradicted by provided evidence.

## Core Process
1. Analyze the original claim and evidence, identifying key facts, quantities, relationships, and crucial details.

2. Select one of the following refutation strategy:
   - Scope Refinement: Alter claim extent while keeping main entity intact. The claim must assert something BEYOND the scope mentioned in the evidence thus making the claim strictly contradict the evidence.
   - Temporal Nuance: Introduce subtle time frame changes .The claim must strictly contradict the time frame in the evidence
   - Quantitative Precision: Modify quantities within refutable range. The claim must state quantities that strictly contradict the evidence
   - Qualitative Shift: Alter disputable qualitative aspects. The claim must assert a quality that strictly contradicts the evidence
   - Relationship Reconfiguration: Modify entity relationships. The claim must assert relationships strictly contradicted by evidence
   - Contextual Reframing: Change refutable circumstances. The claim must place the fact in a context strictly contradicted by evidence 

3. Generate the refuted claim:
   - Use sophisticated Modern Standard Arabic
   - Ensure contradiction requires careful evidence analysis
   - Maintain the main entity and core topic
   - Avoid simple negations or obvious contradictions
   - Avoid adding information that will make the Claim NEI rather than refuted. BE VERY CAREFUL

## Expected  Input
You will receive multiple inputs in the following format:
```
id: original id
Original Evidence: [Arabic]
Original Claim: [Arabic]

Coreference Resolution:
Entity in Refuted Claim: [Entity reference]
Co-referenced to Entity in Evidence: [Entity reference]
Co-referenced to Entity in Original Claim: [Entity reference]
```
## Output Format
##Critical:(Strict Format DO NOT OUTPUT ANYTHING ELSE). 
##For all inputs, provide the output in the following format ONLY:
{
i: "[same id as input]",
t: "[Rule Category on of :Scope Refinement | Temporal Nuance | Quantitative Precision | Qualitative Shift | Relationship Reconfiguration | Contextual Reframing]",
c: "[Refuted Claim: [Arabic]"
}
### END OF OUTPUT FORMAT ###
## Critical Rules
1. Refutations must be definitively contradicted by evidence upon careful examination
2. Fictional characters cannot be proven as real persons (e.g., dogs/cats can be authors in fiction)
3. Movie appearances/jobs lists are not exclusive unless explicitly stated
4. Character roles ≠ actors (e.g., "Tom Cruise performed a heist" is unprovable)
5. Logical inference matters (winning 5 awards implies winning 3; winning implies nomination)
6. For film appearance claims, only birth dates after release or documented later career starts can refute
7. Minimize use of negation tools (لا, لم, لن, ليس, لا يمكن)

## PAY ATTENTION !! THIS IS CRITICAL
## Refined Logical Rules Addition

### 1. Quantity Logic
a) Basic Quantity Rules:
   - If evidence states N:
     * Claims of "more than N" are refuted
     * Claims of "less than N" are refuted
     * Claims of exact numbers ≤N are NOT refuted unless qualified
   
b) Qualifying Words Matter:
   - "Only/Just/Exactly" (فقط/بالضبط/تحديداً) + number changes logical relationship
   - "At least" (على الأقل) is refuted only by evidence of lower numbers
   - "At most" (على الأكثر) is refuted only by evidence of higher numbers

### 2. Range Logic
a) If evidence states range [A-B]:
   - Numbers within [A-B] are NOT refuted
   - Numbers < A are refuted
   - Numbers > B are refuted
   - "Exactly X" within [A-B] is unverifiable unless specified
   - "Only X" within [A-B] is refuted if evidence shows more

b) Range Qualifiers:
   - "More than A" is NOT refuted by evidence of [A-B]
   - "Less than B" is NOT refuted by evidence of [A-B]
   - "Between X and Y" is refuted if X < A or Y > B

### 4. Sequential Logic
- If X achieved N:
  * Claims of achieving < N are NOT refuted
  * Claims of achieving > N are refuted
  * Claims of "only achieved X" where X < N are refuted
  * "Never achieved more than X" where X < N is refuted

### 5. Additional Edge Cases
a) Comparative Claims:
   - "Most/Biggest/Largest" (الأكثر/الأكبر/الأعظم):
     * "One of the most" is NOT refuted by evidence of "the most"
     * "Second most" IS refuted by evidence of "third most"
     * Relative comparisons must match exactly to be refuted

b) Achievement Claims:
   - Winning N awards implies winning 1 to N-1 awards
   - "Won exactly N" is refuted if evidence shows N+1
   - "Never won more than N" is refuted by evidence of N+1 or more
   - "Only won N" is refuted by evidence of any additional wins

## 6. Subset/Superset Logic
a) Group Membership:
   - If A is subset of B:
     * "All A are B" is NOT refuted
     * "All B are A" IS refuted
     * "Some A are B" is NOT refuted
     * "No A are B" IS refuted
   
## 7. Temporal Logic
a) Event Sequence:
   - If A occurred before B:
     * "A after B" is refuted
     * "B before A" is refuted
     * "A while B" is refuted
     * "A during B" requires time range verification

b) Duration Logic:
   - If duration is X:
     * "More than X" is refuted
     * "Less than X" is refuted
     * "About X" is NOT refuted unless variance is specified
     * "Approximately X" requires defined tolerance

## 8. Causation vs. Correlation Logic
- If A correlates with B:
  * "A causes B" is unverifiable unless explicitly stated
  * "B causes A" is unverifiable unless explicitly stated
  * "A and B are related" is NOT refuted
  * "A and B have no relationship" IS refuted

## 9. Conditional Logic
a) If-Then Statements:
   - If "If A then B":
     * "If not A then not B" is unverifiable
     * "If B then A" is unverifiable
     * "Not A and B" is NOT refuted
     * "A and not B" IS refuted

b) Unless Statements:
   - "A unless B" means:
     * If not B then A
     * If B then A is unverifiable

## 10. Exclusivity Logic
- If A is exclusive to B:
  * "Only A does B" means nothing else does B
  * "A only does B" means A does nothing else
  * Both require explicit evidence of exclusivity

## 11. Comparative Sequence Logic
For ordered sequences (rankings, ratings, etc.):
- If A > B > C:
  * "C > B" is refuted
  * "A > C" is NOT refuted (transitive property)
  * "B = C" is refuted
  * "A ≥ B" is NOT refuted


## Arabic Logical Qualifiers Reference
- فقط / حصراً = Only/Exclusively
- بالضبط / تحديداً = Exactly
- على الأقل = At least
- على الأكثر = At most
- ما لا يقل عن = No less than
- ما لا يزيد عن = No more than
- من بين = Among/One of
- أكثر من = More than
- أقل من = Less than

## Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) basic rules:
By following these rules, you will be able to construct clear, coherent, and grammatically correct sentences in Modern Standard Arabic:

1.Subordinate Clauses (جمل فرعية):
   - Relative Clauses (جمل موصولة): Introduced by relative pronouns like الذي (which/who), التي (which/who for feminine), الذين (which/who for plural), etc.
     Example: الكتاب الذي قرأته جيد (The book which I read is good).
  - Conditional Clauses (جمل شرطية): Introduced by conditional particles like إذا (if), إن (if), لو (if, implying something hypothetical).
     Example: إذا درستَ ستنجح (If you study, you will succeed).
  - Temporal Clauses (جمل زمنية): Introduced by temporal conjunctions like عندما (when), حين (when), بعد أن (after), قبل أن (before).
     Example: سأذهب عندما يأتي (I will go when he comes).
  - Causal Clauses (جمل سببية): Introduced by causal conjunctions like لأن (because), بسبب (because of).
     Example: لم يأتِ لأن الجو كان ممطراً (He did not come because the weather was rainy).

2.Agreement (التطابق):
    - Ensure that subjects and verbs agree in gender, number, and person.
    Example: الطالب يقرأ (The student reads) vs. الطالبة تقرأ (The female student reads).
   - Ensure adjectives and pronouns also match in gender, number, and case.
    Example: الطالب المجتهد (The diligent student) vs. الطالبة المجتهدة (The diligent female student).

  Adjective-Noun Agreement (تطابق الصفة والموصوف):
    - Ensure adjectives agree with the nouns they describe in gender, number, and case.
    Example: السيارة الحمراء جميلة (The red car is beautiful).
  - Ensure that adjectives come after the noun they describe and agree in definiteness.
    Example: سيارة حمراء (a red car) vs. السيارة الحمراء (the red car).

3.Verb Placement (ترتيب الفعل):
   - The verb typically precedes the subject in the default VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) word order.
   Example: كتب الطالب الدرس (The student wrote the lesson).
  - For emphasis on the subject or stylistic purposes, SVO or other orders may be used.
   Example: الطالب كتب الدرس (The student wrote the lesson).

4.Conjunctions (أدوات العطف):
   - Use conjunctions like و (and), أو (or), لكن (but), ثم (then) to join clauses.
   Example: درستُ اللغة العربية و أحببتها (I studied Arabic and I liked it).
  - Also, use other conjunctions like بل (but rather), حتى (until), وكذلك (likewise).

5.Use of Proper Connectives (استخدام الروابط المناسبة):
   - To ensure coherence and fluidity, use appropriate connectives and transition words to link clauses.
   Example: بعد أن أنهى عمله، ذهب إلى المنزل (After he finished his work, he went home).

6.Avoid Run-on Sentences (تجنب الجمل الطويلة بلا فواصل):
   - Ensure clarity by not overloading sentences with too many clauses. Use punctuation effectively.
   Example: إذا كان الطقس جميلاً غداً، سأذهب إلى الحديقة ثم أزور صديقي (If the weather is nice tomorrow, I will go to the park, and then visit my friend).

7.Pronoun Reference (مرجع الضمائر):
   - Ensure that pronouns clearly refer to the correct nouns to avoid ambiguity.
   Example: قابلتُ كريستوف  وهو ذاهب إلى السوق (I met Christophe while he was going to the market).

8.Use of Definite and Indefinite Nouns (استخدام الأسماء المعرفة والنكرة):
   - Ensure correct use of the definite article "ال" (the) and the absence of it for indefinite nouns.
   Example: الكتاب جيد (The book is good) vs. كتاب جيد (A good book).

9.Negation (النفي):
    - Learn the proper ways to negate verbs and sentences, using: لا (no/not), لم (did not), لن (will not), and ليس (is not).
    Example: لا أريد الذهاب (I do not want to go).

10.Emphasis (التوكيد):
    - Use emphatic articles and structures such as إنّ (indeed), قد (indeed/already), and التوكيد بالنون (emphasis with nunation) to emphasize statements.
    Example: إنّ الطالبَ مجتهدٌ (Indeed, the student is diligent).

11.Use of the Vocative (النداء):
    - When addressing someone directly, use the vocative particle يا (O).
    Example: يا كريستوف، تعال هنا (O Christophe, come here).

12.Word Order Flexibility (مرونة ترتيب الكلمات):
    - Although VSO is the default order, MSA allows for SVO and other variations for emphasis or style.
    Example: الطالب كتب الدرس (The student wrote the lesson) - emphasizes the student.

## Note: this is a critical task make sure that your refutation does not turn into NEI or remain Supported. DO NOT ADD INFORMATION THAT CANNOT BE REFUTED BY THE EVIDENCE
